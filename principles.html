    <h1>Guiding Principles of LR2</h1>
    <p><em>If socialism speaks of solidarity, communism of the commons, and humanism of dignity, then our guiding principle is this: that the revolution is not a storm to be waited for, but a room to be lived in - now, together, as if it had already arrived.</em></p>
    <h2>The Human First</h2>
    <p>Every ideology, every structure, every ritual exists only to serve human beings, never the other way around. We are not cogs in someone else’s machinery; we are the laughter, the longing, and the limitless potential of being alive together. To be human is to err, to stumble, to dream, to forgive. Our systems must bend to our humanity, not our humanity to the system.</p>
    
    <h2>No One is Free Alone</h2>
    <p>Freedom, when hoarded, shrivels into loneliness. Freedom, when shared, becomes spacious like the sky. As the breath of one tree joins the lungs of another, so too our liberation is collective: I cannot truly be free while my neighbor is bound. We do not seek the private kingdom, but the common ground.</p>
    <h2>From Each, To Each</h2>
    <p>Work is not a punishment, nor wealth a prize. To contribute what one can, and to receive what one needs, is not a transaction but a rhythm - like inhaling and exhaling, giving and taking, without tally or resentment. Life flourishes in reciprocity, and we learn that joy is not diminished by sharing but amplified.</p>
    <h2>Community Over Commodity</h2>
    <p>We live in a world that would sell us back to ourselves. Here, we reclaim what cannot be priced: friendship, song, a warm kitchen, the courage of a hand held in the dark. We are not for sale. The measure of value is not profit but the depth of our bonds to one another.</p>
    <h2>Respect as Recognition</h2>
    <p>Respect is not a rigid rule; it is the recognition of the sacred in another. To look at someone - truly look - is to see a whole universe looking back. Boundaries, consent, and care are simply the natural consequences of that recognition. What I do to you, I do to myself.</p>
    <h2>The House as a Microcosm</h2>
    <p>This home is not the revolution, but a rehearsal. A stage on which we stumble through new ways of being, so that beyond these walls we may carry the rehearsal into the wider world. The kitchen table becomes a parliament, the chore wheel an economic plan, the shared meal a manifesto.</p>
