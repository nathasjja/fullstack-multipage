    <h2>How We Started</h2>
    <p class="lead dropcap">
      In 2023, I came home to Indonesia from Denmark with a stubborn idea: that change is local and made together. I tried on initiatives like borrowed jackets; useful, familiar, but never quite mine. Then I found <strong>Bali Book Party</strong>: a literacy community stubbornly inclusive, quietly radical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through BBP I met <strong>Ayu</strong>, and we started working side by side. Along the way came <strong>Muflih</strong>, someone I had written off at first, tangled (I thought) in the upper-class machinery I resisted. Life, unbothered by my certainty, introduced us properly; friendship grew where judgment had stood. <strong>Ihsan Jarot</strong>, a poet among our peers, drifted into the circle next, adding rhythm where we’d only had prose.
    </p>
    <p>
      My quiet two-story house in the middle of nowhere became our commons. People cooked, argued, read, played chess, or music, repaired shelves and selves. The conversations grew political not by plan but by necessity. In time, <strong>Ayu</strong> and <strong>Syahriel</strong> folded in as if the door had been waiting for them. We called it <strong>Living Room Revolutionists</strong>.
