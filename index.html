        A home for rebuilding and belonging in bold everyday structure. We transmute shame to systems that work for us, isolation to fellowship, and chaos/calm into a unified entity.

        <p><strong>What we are:</strong> a living room with 'rules' (controlled deviation), a workshop for life skills, and a porch for honest talk.</p>
        <p><strong>What we are not:</strong> a revolving door, a lecture hall, or a place where you go to 'escape' loneliness.</p>

    <h2>At a Glance</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Quantum Entanglement:</strong>
        <p>We recognise and value the needs and experiences of each individuals as part of our own, fostering a culture of empathy, understanding, and mutual growth. 
            We do not subscribe to the idea of competition. By virtue of humanity, if one of us wins, we all win.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong>
        <p>We believe in the power of collaboration, working together to create, or rather embody solutions that benefit everyone - simultaneously
            benefits us, for we are all one and the same.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Inclusive:</strong>
        <p>We strive to create an inclusive environment where all voices are heard and valued. As long as they're not for the ruling class... We'll still include you, 
            and our principles of unity still applies to you (after your waterboarding/lobotomy session)
