    <h1>MAIN HOUSE RULES</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Keys</strong> - Keep the house locked when no one is home. Never share information about the house or its members with outsiders. Like they say in the movie fight club. <strong>Rule #1: You do not talk about fight club.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Noise</strong> - Keep noise to a minimum after 11:00 PM. We're already a bit on the edge, so let's keep the peace.</li>
        <li><strong>Guests</strong> - Always inform host about bringing guests who are not part of the household. This includes day visitors and overnight guests.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Spaces</strong> - Clean up after yourself and respect others' privacy. This includes keeping common areas tidy and not accessing personal items without permission - like personal journals, wardrobe, storage spaces, etc....</li>
        <li><strong>Cats</strong> - Respect the cats' space and needs. Always check their body language before interacting with them.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Items</strong> - Always ask before using someone else's belongings, and return them in the condition you found them.</li>
        <li><strong>Mail</strong> - Respect the privacy of others' mail. Don't open or read anything that isn't addressed to you.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>PEACE</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Resolve conflicts collectively:</strong> Disagreements are part of growth; we use dialogue and mediation, not dominance.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect the sanctuary:</strong> This house is a refuge from harm, exploitation, and coercion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>LOVE</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Care is a duty:</strong> We look after one another’s health, safety, and dignity as much as our own.</li>
      <li><strong>Generosity over scarcity.:</strong> Share food, tools, and time. When one of us eats, we all eat..</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Unity</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>We build together, not alone:</strong> No one carries the load in silence.</li>
      <li><strong>Solidarity is non-negotiable:</strong> When one of us struggles, the rest lean in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Respect</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>Respect labor:</strong> Every contribution counts - whether it’s sweeping the floor, writing in the collective journal, or cooking a meal.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect the commons:</strong> Clean what you use, replace what you finish, leave the world better than you found it.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Socialist Grounding</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>From each according to ability, to each according to need.</strong> Workload is distributed fairly, but compassion trumps rigidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Collective decisions.</strong> Major choices - new members, events, house policies, finances - are made by group consensus.</li>
  <li><strong>Reject hierarchy.</strong> Roles exist for function, not for status; nobody’s voice outweighs another’s.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Community before commodity. No buying and selling within the house; exchange is based on trust, care, and mutual aid.</h4>
