          <p class="member-role">Founder</p>
          <p class="member-blurb">Research Associate, Project Manager, Localisation Consultant, Nathasjja is a bit of a generalist.  
            owns the studio in which our meetings are hosted. An avid believer in socialism and community-driven initiatives. Nathasjja returned 
            to Indonesia from Europe, upon realising micro revolutions matter more to her than macro comforts. </p>
            <p class="member-blurb"> Nathasjja believes that real change starts in living rooms, not meeting halls full of mice in suits, and is dedicated to building a community rooted in solidarity, mutual aid, and creativity.</p>

          <h3 class="member-name">Ayu</h3>
          <p class="member-role">'Public Relations' — a formal term for scapegoat</p>
          <p class="member-blurb">Ayu is an enigma. No one knows her last name, nor if her first
            name is even her real name. What does she do for a living? Only she and God knows. She is the group's designated scapegoat, taking the fall for any potential
            conflict with the authorities. Not because she's not valuable, rather because her unassuming sweetness
            is exactly what is needed to keep us safe.

        </a>
        <figcaption>
          <h3 class="member-name">Muflih Mappaujung</h3>
          <p class="member-role">'Researcher' — Information Gathering</p>
          <p class="member-blurb">Muflih is our go-to for insider knowledge on the ruling class.  Whether it's 
            careless urban development or potential threats, he has his ear to the ground. Muflih started off
            as an anthropologist, but quickly transitioned to activism when he saw the impact of policy on marginalized communities.
            A man with principles in the vessel of what seems to be a 'conformist', Muflih makes the perfect trojan horse left at the gates
            of the rich, greedy, and powerful.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <h3 class="member-name">Ihsan 'Jarot' Hakim</h3>
          <p class="member-role">Creative Strategist</p>
          <p class="member-blurb">Melancholy is the muse that fuels Jarot's creativity. Along with this, comes a deep understanding of the human experience, allowing him to craft narratives that resonate on a personal level.
            He brings much-needed hope and vision to empower a revolution, reminding us that creativity is a powerful tool for change. Jarot's ability to turn ideas into action inspires others to believe in the possibility of a better future.
            Because what else is there to do when the world feels so heavy? Jarot channels this weight into his work, transforming pain into art and action.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <h3 class="member-name">Syahriel</h3>
          <p class="member-role">Finance Manager - the only one out of all of us who knows anything about money</p>
        <p class="member-blurb">A marketing specialist who thinks in spreadsheets and stock graphs. Syahriel stumbled into the living-room rebellion via misdirected calendar invite and never looked back - now he applies cost‑benefit analysis to street art, turns household budgets into mutual‑aid stashes, and insists on reconciling the books after every planning session. Equally skilled at filing expense reports and filing committee motions, he proves you can radicalize your ledger without losing your calculator.</p>

          <h3 class="member-name">Musa Al-Rafiq Binti Nathasjja</h3>
          <p class="member-role">Prophet</p>
          <p class="member-blurb">"For every Firaun, there will come a Musa". She will reveal to us when the time is right to act 
            - usually by bringing home an animal as an omen, meowing insistently, or leading a quiet reconnaissance. 
            As the group's resident feline prophet she communicates strategy with a tail flick and a constant look of disapproval, 
            naps on our manifestos to bless them, and reminds us that small, clever mischief can keep a home anarchist movement alive.</p>
